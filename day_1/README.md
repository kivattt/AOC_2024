This problem involves parsing a file for two integer arrays, sorting the two arrays, and summing the differences (absolute magnitudes) bettween them. The problem is described elaborately on the [official site](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1).

This is a go program. Run it with `go run .`. You will need go installed.
